# AW

[中文版](README_zh.md)

AW provides a shared configuration and local service for Agent policies. On
Linux, it starts Qoder CLI, OpenClaw, QwenPaw and Hermes through verified native
entrypoints,
runs external Providers and keeps execution metadata independently of an Agent
session. Native scheduling and permissions remain with the framework; the
current interfaces are experimental.

AW Preview provides core and Provider packages installed with `aw-package`. It
currently includes the sec-core Provider and an example sharing one configuration
between Qoder and OpenClaw; see [Preview installation and demo](../../docs/user-guide/en/user-entrypoint/aw-preview.md).

AW core can be built and initialized without sec-core. `aw-build` defaults to
core; select `--component all` for the existing combined distribution.
`aw-package configure` accepts one Agent and no Provider by default; select
`--provider sec-core` or `--provider command` explicitly. Boolean commands return
only true/false, with effects declared in YAML; AW supplies the Provider handshake
and response correlation. See [boolean policy commands](../../docs/user-guide/en/user-entrypoint/aw.md#boolean-policy-commands).

## Run Qoder

AW is not yet available through `anolisa install` or an RPM. On Linux, install
rustup and Qoder CLI 1.1.64, then build from the repository root. Update the
example's `spec.agents.qoder.argv` if that Qoder version is outside `PATH`.

```bash
cd src/aw
cargo build --locked -p aw-service --bin aw
target/debug/aw validate --config crates/aw-service/examples/aw.qoder.yaml
target/debug/aw run --config crates/aw-service/examples/aw.qoder.yaml --agent qoder
```

The example runs a neutral command before and after successful tools. It
demonstrates Hook execution; it does not install security rules. AW starts or
reuses the configured service and opens Qoder's normal interface. Exiting Qoder
returns to the original terminal and releases that session; the shared service
and audit history remain available.

```bash
target/debug/aw status --config crates/aw-service/examples/aw.qoder.yaml
target/debug/aw stop --config crates/aw-service/examples/aw.qoder.yaml
```

The [user guide](../../docs/user-guide/en/user-entrypoint/aw.md) explains native
settings coexistence, serial/parallel Hooks, Provider configuration, explicit
service startup and record queries. Native Hooks retain their framework's
limits; service status alone does not prove that Qoder adopted a policy.

`aw --help` lists the launcher commands and adapter-specific options. Qoder
accepts `--native-settings` with `aw run`; it rejects `--native-profile`,
`--native-state-dir` and `aw install`. The `install` command dispatches persistent
native Hook setup, supported by Hermes; it does not install
AW or an Agent. See the user guide for the command and option support table.
Before upgrading, stop old daemon instances with the old AW executable; the
current CLI rejects the previous local protocol. See the user guide for upgrade steps.

## sec-core Provider

The Linux `aw-provider-sec-core` binary maps configured tool inputs to the public
`agent-sec-cli scan-code` command. It supplies candidate before-tool observe/block
and after-tool observation through the AW Provider protocol. It requires an
existing sec-core CLI and daemon; no AW code is installed inside sec-core.
See the [sec-core Provider guide](../../docs/user-guide/en/user-entrypoint/aw-sec-core.md)
for source builds, configuration and a local Host example.

## Run OpenClaw

Use OpenClaw 2026.9.6 with its existing native model configuration.
The [user guide](../../docs/user-guide/en/user-entrypoint/aw.md) explains the
required working directory and supported tool lifecycle. From `src/aw`:

```bash
target/debug/aw run --config crates/aw-service/examples/aw.openclaw.yaml --agent openclaw \
  --native-settings /absolute/openclaw.json --native-state-dir /absolute/openclaw-state
```

## Run QwenPaw

Use QwenPaw 2.2.2b4 / AgentScope 2.0.8 with its existing native model configuration.
The [user guide](../../docs/user-guide/en/user-entrypoint/aw.md) explains the
required working directory and supported tool lifecycle. From `src/aw`:

```bash
QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR=/absolute/qwenpaw-home target/debug/aw run \
  --config crates/aw-service/examples/aw.qwenpaw.yaml --agent qwenpaw \
  -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8096
```

## Run Hermes

Use Hermes official revision `952c941e` with no tracked file changes and its existing
native model configuration. An existing profile `.env` must be a caller-owned
regular file without group/other write permission.
The Agent executable must be its installed Python console script, with an absolute
Python shebang; shell wrappers are unsupported. AW requires plugin registration
before chat starts and rejects effective `HERMES_SAFE_MODE` settings. Installation
retains both the initial backup and the displaced configuration inode; review
them before rollback, and stop native config writers during installation. Profile
ancestors must prevent replacement by other users; interrupted installation
cleans up its native writers and staging files. Interrupted install/run probes
report their errors before restoring the signal status. Installation rejects
unsupported configured entrypoints/options before probing or changing the profile;
an executable-only `argv` can supply `chat` through `aw run --`.
For a mismatched bundled plugin, stop Hermes sessions, move `plugins/aw-native-hooks`
to a backup outside the profile's `plugins` directory, then rerun `aw install`.
The [user guide](../../docs/user-guide/en/user-entrypoint/aw.md) explains the
required profile options and supported tool lifecycle. From `src/aw`:

```bash
target/debug/aw install --config crates/aw-service/examples/aw.hermes.yaml --agent hermes \
  --native-profile /absolute/hermes-profile
target/debug/aw run --config crates/aw-service/examples/aw.hermes.yaml --agent hermes \
  --native-profile /absolute/hermes-profile
```

## Integration and development

The reusable `aw-service::Client` binds to one service generation and configuration
revision. Adapters normalize callbacks and retain native scheduling. Related
callbacks share one event deadline, and each step may be attempted once. The
service records execution metadata before returning results and never retries
an uncertain call automatically.

`aw-host` supports both structured Provider messages and explicitly selected
native Hook byte transport. `aw-core` provides a separate pinned-plan execution
API and the durable `FileJournal` storage reused by the service. These boundaries
leave cosh, desktop clients and Herdr independent of the service implementation.
