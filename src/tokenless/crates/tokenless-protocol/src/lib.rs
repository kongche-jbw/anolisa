//! Versioned compression protocol shared by every tokenless frontend.
//!
//! This crate defines protocol v1 (evolution roadmap §4.1): the compatibility
//! boundary between agent-specific adapters and the shared compression
//! pipeline. It is deliberately not an OpenAI or Anthropic request shape —
//! [`CompressionRequest`] carries only the model-visible content plus the
//! attribution and capability facts the pipeline needs, and
//! [`CompressionResponse`] carries the final content plus the decision the
//! adapter needs to build its host-specific envelope.
//!
//! The roadmap section numbers cited throughout this crate (§4.1, §4.5,
//! §5.1, §5.6, …) refer to the tokenless evolution roadmap, which has not
//! landed in this repository yet. Until it does, the JSON examples and
//! contract tests in this crate are the authoritative wire contract.
//!
//! # Compatibility rules
//!
//! - Readers ignore unknown fields within a supported major protocol version,
//!   so optional fields may be added without a version bump.
//! - An incompatible shape requires a new `protocol_version`, never a
//!   parallel adapter-specific payload.
//! - [`CompressionRequest::from_json`] / [`CompressionResponse::from_json`]
//!   check the version before the full parse, so a future version is reported
//!   as [`ProtocolError::UnsupportedVersion`] rather than a shape error.
//!
//! # Fail-open contract
//!
//! `CompressionResponse::output` always holds exactly what the adapter must
//! emit. On every non-[`Disposition::Applied`] disposition it is the original
//! model-visible content, so adapters never need fallback logic of their own
//! (roadmap principle 6).
//!
//! # Token counter identity
//!
//! Token counts use the counter named by each response's `tokenizer_id`.
//! Normal processing uses [`TOKENIZER_ID`], the character-class heuristic
//! `heuristic-v1`. Inputs rejected before a text scan use
//! [`BYTE_ESTIMATOR_ID`]. Counts are normalized tokens for arbitration and
//! attribution, not billing estimates.
